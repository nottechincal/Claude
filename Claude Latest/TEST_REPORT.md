## 🔍 DETAILED TEST RESULTS

### 1. Basic Functionality (2/2 PASS - 100%)
✅ Shop open status check - PASS
✅ Caller information retrieval - PASS

### 2. Kebab Tests (5/6 PASS - 83%)
✅ Small chicken kebab - PASS
✅ Large lamb kebab with extras - PASS
✅ Mix kebab - PASS
✅ Falafel kebab - PASS
❌ Kebab with NO salads - FAIL (empty array not preserved)
✅ Kebab with NO sauces - PASS

**Issue Found:** When setting salads to empty array `[]`, the server reverts to previous cart's salads. This is a session isolation bug.

### 3. HSP Tests (4/4 PASS - 100%)
✅ Small lamb HSP - PASS
✅ Large chicken HSP (no cheese) - PASS
✅ Mix HSP - PASS
✅ Falafel HSP - PASS

### 4. Chips Tests (1/3 PASS - 33%)
✅ Small chips with default chicken salt - PASS
❌ Large chips with normal salt - FAIL (defaults to chicken)
❌ Small chips with no salt - FAIL (defaults to chicken)

**Issue Found:** `salt_type` parameter is not being set correctly via `setItemProperty`. Defaults always apply.

### 5. Drinks Tests (1/2 PASS - 50%)
✅ Single drink (Coca-Cola) - PASS
❌ Multiple drinks - FAIL (cart accumulation issue)

**Issue Found:** Cart not clearing between tests - session isolation problem.

### 6. Combo Detection Tests (8/8 DETECTED - 100% Detection)
✅ Small Kebab + Can → Combo detected ✓
✅ Large Kebab + Can → Combo detected ✓
✅ Small Kebab + Small Chips + Can → Meal detected ✓
✅ Large Kebab + Small Chips + Can → Meal detected ✓
✅ Large Kebab + Large Chips + Can → Meal detected ✓
✅ Small HSP + Can → Combo detected ✓
✅ Large HSP + Can → Combo detected ✓
✅ Kebab + Chips (no drink) → No combo ✓

**Note:** All combos detected correctly! However, pricing is incorrect due to cart accumulation.

### 7. Error Handling Tests (6/7 PASS - 86%)
✅ Invalid category - PASS
✅ Missing size field - PASS (correctly rejected)
✅ Missing protein field - PASS (correctly rejected)
✅ Add to cart without config - PASS (correctly rejected)
❌ Set property without config - FAIL (should reject but doesn't)
✅ Invalid protein type - PASS
✅ Invalid drink brand - PASS

### 8. Quantity Tests (0/1 PASS - 0%)
❌ Multiple quantity (3x kebabs) - FAIL (quantity not applied)

**Issue Found:** `quantity` parameter via `setItemProperty` is not working.

### 9. Pricing Tests (0/3 PASS - 0%)
❌ Cheese extra pricing - FAIL (cart accumulation)
❌ Multiple sauce pricing - FAIL (cart accumulation)
❌ Empty cart pricing - FAIL (cart not empty due to accumulation)

**Issue Found:** All pricing tests fail due to session not being cleared. Cart accumulates from previous tests.

### 10. Complete Order Flow (1/1 PASS - 100%)
✅ End-to-end order creation - PASS

### 11. Performance Tests (1/1 PASS - 100%)

## 🐛 ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### CRITICAL Issues

#### 1. **Session Isolation Problem** (CRITICAL)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Cart not clearing between different phone calls/sessions
**Evidence:**
- Test expects 3 items in cart, actually has 7
- Prices accumulating from previous orders
- Multiple drinks test fails (13 items instead of 5)

**Root Cause:** Sessions are keyed by phone number. In tests, same phone number is used, so cart persists across all tests.

**Fix Required:** Add a `clearSession` tool or use different phone numbers per test.

---

### MODERATE Issues

#### 2. **setItemProperty - Empty Arrays Not Preserved**
**Severity:** MODERATE
**Impact:** Cannot set empty salads/sauces (customer wants "no salads")
**Evidence:**
- Setting `salads: []` results in previous cart's salads
- Test "Kebab with NO salads" fails

**Fix Required:** Check `setItemProperty` handling of empty arrays.

---

#### 3. **setItemProperty - salt_type Not Working**
**Severity:** MODERATE
**Impact:** Cannot change chip salt from default chicken salt
**Evidence:**
- Setting `salt_type: "normal"` → results in "chicken"
- Setting `salt_type: "none"` → results in "chicken"

**Fix Required:** Verify `salt_type` is being applied in `ItemState` class.

---

#### 4. **setItemProperty - quantity Not Working**
**Severity:** MODERATE
**Impact:** Cannot order multiple of same item efficiently
**Evidence:**
- Setting `quantity: 3` → results in `quantity: 1`

**Fix Required:** Verify `quantity` field in `setItemProperty`.

---

### MINOR Issues

#### 5. **Set Property Without Config Should Reject**
**Severity:** LOW
**Impact:** Error handling not strict enough
**Evidence:** Test expects rejection but tool accepts it

**Fix Required:** Add validation in `setItemProperty` to check `current_item` exists.

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Fixes (Before Production)

#### 1. Fix Session Management
```python
# Add to server_v2.py:
def tool_clear_session(params):
    """Clear current session (for testing)"""
    session_clear()
    return {"ok": True, "message": "Session cleared"}

TOOLS["clearSession"] = tool_clear_session
```

#### 2. Fix setItemProperty - Empty Arrays
```python
# In tool_set_item_property, change:
if field == "salads":
    item_state.salads = value if isinstance(value, list) else [value] if value else []

# To explicitly handle empty:
if field == "salads":
    if value == [] or value == "[]":
        item_state.salads = []
    else:
        item_state.salads = value if isinstance(value, list) else [value] if value else []
```

#### 3. Fix setItemProperty - salt_type
Check that `ItemState.salt_type` defaults are being overridden correctly. May need to check menu.json defaults.

#### 4. Fix setItemProperty - quantity
Ensure quantity field is in VAPI tool schema and being parsed correctly.

---

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Add clearSession tool** for testing and "start over" scenarios
2. **Improve pricing calculation** to handle edge cases better
3. **Add validation** for setItemProperty without active config
4. **Session expiration** after X minutes of inactivity

---

## 💡 NEXT STEPS

### For You to Test (Real VAPI Call)

**Test 1: Cart Modification**
```
Call your number and say:
"Small chicken kebab with lettuce, tomato, and garlic sauce"
Wait for confirmation
"Actually remove the garlic sauce"
```
**Expected:** Assistant should call `editCartItem` and confirm removal.

---

**Test 2: Complex Order**
```
"I want a small chicken kebab with lettuce and tomato,
large lamb HSP with cheese and all the sauces,
chips with no salt, and two cokes"
```
**Expected:** All items added, HSP+coke detected as combo, fast processing.

---

**Test 3: Start Over**
```
During order: "Actually, start over"
```
**Expected:** Assistant calls `clearCart` and begins fresh.

---
