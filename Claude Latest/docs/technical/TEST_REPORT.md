## ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED

### Issues Fixed in This Update

#### 1. **Session Isolation Problem** ✅ FIXED
**Was:** Cart accumulating between different calls/sessions
**Fixed By:**
- Implemented proper session management with timestamps
- Added 15-minute SESSION_TIMEOUT with last_activity tracking
- Changed from defaultdict to explicit dict
- Added `_ensure_session()` to create/update sessions
- Added `_clean_expired_sessions()` on endCall
- Added `session_reset()` for explicit clearing

**Result:** Sessions now properly isolated. No cart accumulation.

---

#### 2. **Empty Arrays Not Preserved** ✅ FIXED
**Was:** Setting `salads: []` resulted in None or previous values
**Fixed By:**
- Changed `to_cart_item()` to use `if self.salads is not None:` instead of `if self.salads:`
- Added explicit empty array handling in `setItemProperty`
- JSON parsing for array values sent as strings

**Result:** Empty arrays preserved correctly. Customers can order "no salads" or "no sauces".

---

#### 3. **salt_type Not Working** ✅ FIXED
**Was:** Setting salt_type always defaulted to "chicken"
**Fixed By:**
- Added explicit salt_type handling in `setItemProperty`
- Proper value parsing: `item_state.salt_type = str(parsed_value) if parsed_value else "chicken"`
- Added logging for debugging

**Result:** All salt types working: "chicken", "normal", "none"

---

#### 4. **quantity Not Working** ✅ FIXED
**Was:** Setting quantity always resulted in 1
**Fixed By:**
- Added explicit quantity parsing with type conversion
- Error handling for invalid values
- Added logging for debugging

**Result:** Quantity parameter working correctly. Can order multiple items efficiently.

---

#### 5. **Pricing Returning $0.00** ✅ FIXED
**Was:** All pricing calculations returned $0.00
**Fixed By:**
1. Fixed JSON syntax errors in menu.json (lines 703, 730)
2. Rewrote `calculate_item_price()` to use category + size instead of name matching
3. Category-based pricing:
   - kebabs: small=$10, large=$15
   - hsp: small=$15, large=$20
   - chips: small=$5, large=$8
   - drinks: $3
4. Fixed extras pricing (cheese $1, meat $3)
5. Fixed sauce pricing (>2 sauces = $0.50 each extra)

**Result:** All pricing accurate and tested at 100%.

---

#### 6. **JSON Syntax Errors in menu.json** ✅ FIXED
**Was:** Menu wouldn't load due to JSON errors
**Fixed By:**
- Line 703: Added missing comma
- Line 730: Removed trailing comma
- Validated with `python3 -m json.tool`

**Result:** Menu loads correctly, all pricing calculations working.

## 🎯 NEW FEATURES ADDED

### clearSession Tool (NEW)
Added ability to reset entire session (cart, config, state):

```python
def tool_clear_session(params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Clear/reset the current session (for testing or starting fresh)"""
    cart = session_get("cart", [])
    item_count = len(cart)
    session_reset()
    return {
        "ok": True,
        "message": f"Session reset. Cleared {item_count} cart items.",
        "itemsCleared": item_count
    }
```

**Use Cases:**
- Testing: Clear state between test runs
- Customer: "Actually, start over completely"
- Debugging: Reset session without restarting server
