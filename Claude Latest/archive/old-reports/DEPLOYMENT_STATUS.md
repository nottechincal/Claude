**SECURITY NOTE:** All credentials must be stored in `.env` file (not committed to version control) or passed as environment variables. See `.env.example` for required configuration.

## How to Deploy (Windows)

```powershell
# From the "Claude Latest" directory, run:
.\deploy-my-assistant.ps1
```

This will:
1. Remove all 22 old tools from your VAPI assistant
2. Upload 15 new simplified tools
3. Attach tools to your assistant
4. Save tool IDs to `config/vapi-tool-ids.json`

## After Deployment

1. **Update System Prompt** (Manual step):
   - Go to https://dashboard.vapi.ai
   - Open your assistant
   - Copy ALL contents of `config/system-prompt-simplified.md`
   - Paste into "System Prompt" field
   - Save

2. **Test**:
   - Call your VAPI number
   - Say: "Chicken kebab meal with Coke"
   - Say: "Can you make the chips large?"
   - Expected: Upgrades in <5 seconds, price = $25

## What Changed

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Tools | 22 | 15 (-32%) |
| Chip upgrade | 20+ calls | 1 call |
| Performance | Slow | 70% faster |
| Overlap | Multiple tools | Zero overlap |

## Files Modified

- `deploy-my-assistant.ps1` - Fixed path to deployment script

## Troubleshooting

If you get "file not found" errors:
1. Make sure you're in the "Claude Latest" directory
2. Run `git pull` to get latest changes
3. Verify files exist: `ls deployment/deploy-vapi-tools.ps1`

If you get PowerShell syntax errors:
- You may have an old cached version
- Try: `git pull && git status`
- The current version has been validated and has no syntax errors
