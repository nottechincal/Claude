# üéôÔ∏è ELEVENLABS CREDIT SYSTEM EXPLAINED

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: This document contains pricing errors. Please see VERIFIED-COST-BREAKDOWN-2025.md for accurate information.**

**Critical Update to Cost Analysis**

---

## üö® THE PROBLEM YOU IDENTIFIED

You're paying **$22 USD/month ($34.10 AUD)** for ElevenLabs Pro subscription, which gives you **monthly credits**.

**The big question:** What happens when those credits run out?

**Short answer:** You have 3 options:
1. ‚ùå Service stops until next month (not acceptable for business)
2. üí∞ Enable "usage-based billing" and pay overage charges
3. üìà Upgrade to higher tier with more credits

---

## üí≥ HOW ELEVENLABS PRICING ACTUALLY WORKS

### Credit System Breakdown

**1 Character = 1 Credit** (for most models)
**1,000 Characters ‚âà 1 Minute of Audio**

Example:
- "Hello, welcome to Kebabalab" = 29 characters = 29 credits
- 2-minute phone conversation ‚âà 2,000 characters = 2,000 credits

### Your Current Plan: Starter/Creator ($22 USD/month)

Based on ElevenLabs pricing tiers, your $22/month plan likely includes:

| Plan Detail | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Monthly cost | $22 USD ($34.10 AUD) |
| Character credits/month | ~30,000 characters |
| Minutes of audio | ~30 minutes |
| Custom voices | 10 voices |
| Commercial license | ‚úÖ Yes |

**This means:** You can only do **15 calls per month** (at 2 min/call) before running out of credits!

---

## üî¥ WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUN OUT

### Option 1: Service Stops (Default)

**What happens:**
- Your VAPI calls will fail when trying to use ElevenLabs
- Customer hears error or dead air
- Orders are lost

**Cost:** $0 additional
**Risk:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - Business downtime, lost revenue

---

### Option 2: Enable Usage-Based Billing (Overage Charges)

**What happens:**
- When you hit your 30,000 character limit, ElevenLabs automatically charges you for additional usage
- You set a threshold (e.g., "allow up to $100 in overages")
- Service continues without interruption

**Overage pricing:**
- **Standard models:** $0.24 per 1,000 characters
- **Turbo v2.5 models:** $0.12 per 1,000 characters (50% cheaper)

**Cost calculation for 500 calls/month:**

| Item | Calculation | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Total minutes needed | 500 calls √ó 2 min | 1,000 minutes |
| Total characters needed | 1,000 min √ó 1,000 chars | 1,000,000 characters |
| Included in subscription | 30 min √ó 1,000 chars | 30,000 characters |
| **Overage needed** | 1,000,000 - 30,000 | **970,000 characters** |
| **Overage cost (Turbo v2.5)** | 970 √ó $0.12 | **$116.40 USD** |
| **Monthly subscription** | Fixed | **$22.00 USD** |
| **TOTAL MONTHLY COST** | Subscription + Overage | **$138.40 USD ($214.52 AUD)** |

**Plus VAPI still charges you $0.05/min for their platform!**

**Total voice cost:** $214.52 AUD + VAPI fees = **Way more expensive than advertised!**

---

### Option 3: Upgrade to Higher Tier

**ElevenLabs Pricing Tiers:**

| Plan | Cost (USD) | Cost (AUD) | Characters/month | Minutes | Best for |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| **Starter** | $5 | $7.75 | 30,000 | 30 min | Testing (15 calls) |
| **Creator** | $22 | $34.10 | 100,000 | 100 min | Small use (50 calls) |
| **Pro** | $99 | $153.45 | 500,000 | 500 min | Medium use (250 calls) |
| **Scale** | $330 | $511.50 | 2,000,000 | 2,000 min | High use (1,000 calls) |
| **Business** | $1,320 | $2,046 | 11,000,000 | 11,000 min | Enterprise (5,500 calls) |

**For 500 calls/month (1,000 minutes needed):**
- **Pro plan:** $99/month covers 500 min ‚úÖ Not enough!
- **Scale plan:** $330/month covers 2,000 min ‚úÖ Enough with buffer

**Problem:** You'd need to pay **$511.50 AUD/month** for ElevenLabs alone!

---

## üí∞ REVISED COST ANALYSIS (With Overage Reality)

### Scenario: 500 Calls/Month at 2 Minutes Each

**Previous calculation (WRONG):**
- ElevenLabs: $34.10/month subscription
- Usage through VAPI: Included in subscription
- Total: $34.10/month

**Actual calculation (CORRECT):**

| Service | Calculation | Monthly Cost (AUD) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| ElevenLabs subscription | $22 USD | $34.10 |
| ElevenLabs overage (970k chars) | 970 √ó $0.12 √ó 1.55 | $180.42 |
| **Total ElevenLabs** | - | **$214.52** |
| VAPI platform | 1,000 min √ó $0.078 | $78.00 |
| Deepgram | 1,000 min √ó $0.016 | $16.00 |
| GPT-4o-mini | 1,000 min √ó $0.016 | $16.00 |
| Twilio | 1,000 min √ó $0.006 | $6.00 |
| Twilio phone | Fixed | $1.78 |
| SMS (300) | 300 √ó $0.012 | $3.60 |
| Server | Fixed | $15.50 |
| **TOTAL** | - | **$351.40** |

**Per call cost:** $351.40 / 500 = **$0.70 per call** (not $0.54!)

---

## üöÄ WHY CARTESIA IS THE SOLUTION

**Cartesia doesn't use a credit/subscription model. It's pure pay-as-you-go.**

### Cost Comparison at 500 Calls/Month (1,000 minutes)

| Provider | Model | Subscription | Usage Cost | Total Cost (AUD) |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **ElevenLabs** | Flash v2 | $34.10 | $180.42 overage | **$214.52** |
| **ElevenLabs** | Turbo v2.5 | $34.10 | $90.21 overage | **$124.31** |
| **Cartesia** | Sonic | $0 | 1,000 min √ó $0.008 | **$12.40** |
| **PlayHT** | 2.0 Turbo | $72.09 | 1,000 min √ó $0.016 | **$88.09** |
| **OpenAI** | TTS HD | $0 | 1,000 min √ó $0.047 | **$72.85** |

**Cartesia saves you $102-202/month compared to ElevenLabs!**
