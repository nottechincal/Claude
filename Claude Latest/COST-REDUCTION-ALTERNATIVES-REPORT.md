- Year 2 profit: **$686** (full savings)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Voice Quality Degradation

**Risk:** Cartesia voice doesn't sound as good as ElevenLabs

**Mitigation:**
1. Test extensively before go-live (50+ test calls)
2. Get customer feedback
3. Keep ElevenLabs subscription for 1 month overlap
4. Can roll back easily

**Likelihood:** Low (Cartesia quality is excellent)

---

### Risk 2: Telnyx Reliability Issues

**Risk:** Call quality or SMS delivery problems

**Mitigation:**
1. Run parallel for 2 weeks (both Twilio + Telnyx)
2. Monitor delivery rates closely
3. Keep Twilio as hot backup
4. Telnyx SLA is 99.999% (same as Twilio)

**Likelihood:** Very Low (Telnyx is Tier 1 carrier)

---

### Risk 3: VAPI Integration Problems

**Risk:** Cartesia or Telnyx don't work well with VAPI

**Mitigation:**
1. VAPI officially supports both providers
2. Test in sandbox environment first
3. VAPI support can help if issues
4. Fallback to current setup if critical

**Likelihood:** Very Low (both are VAPI partners)

---

### Risk 4: Development Time Overruns

**Risk:** Migration takes longer than planned

**Mitigation:**
1. Timeline includes buffer (1-2 weeks vs 3-4 days actual)
2. Do it in phases (voice first, then phone)
3. No downtime required
4. Can pause and resume anytime

**Likelihood:** Low

---
