## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE: YOU'RE PAYING TWICE FOR VOICE!

**Problem:** You have ElevenLabs voice ID linked to VAPI, but VAPI is ALSO charging you for ElevenLabs Flash v2.5.

**What this means:**
- ElevenLabs is taking credits from your account (100,000 credits = finished)
- VAPI is ALSO billing you for ElevenLabs usage
- **You're paying double for the same service!**

**Fix:** Remove your ElevenLabs API key from VAPI and just use VAPI's built-in ElevenLabs (simpler, cheaper, no credit limits)

## üíº BUSINESS MODEL OPTIONS

### Option 1: Monthly Subscription (Simple)

**How it works:**
- Restaurant pays fixed monthly fee
- Unlimited calls included
- Easy to budget and sell

**Recommended Pricing Tiers:**

| Tier | Calls/Month | Your Cost | Charge Customer | Your Profit | Margin |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **Starter** | 0-100 | $80 | $200/month | $120 | 60% |
| **Growth** | 101-300 | $150 | $400/month | $250 | 63% |
| **Pro** | 301-600 | $300 | $650/month | $350 | 54% |
| **Enterprise** | 601-1000 | $566 | $1,000/month | $434 | 43% |

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Predictable revenue for you
- ‚úÖ Easy for customers to understand
- ‚úÖ Good for restaurants with consistent volume

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Risk: customer uses more than expected
- ‚ùå Underutilization: customer doesn't use full allowance

---

### Option 2: Per-Order Commission (Recommended)

**How it works:**
- You charge $3-$5 per successful order placed
- Customer only pays when they make money
- Aligns your interests with customer success

**Recommended Pricing:**

| Pricing | Break-Even Point | Profit at 100 Orders | Profit at 500 Orders |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **$3.00/order** | 27 orders | $220/month (73%) | $1,204/month (81%) |
| **$3.50/order** | 23 orders | $270/month (77%) | $1,454/month (83%) |
| **$4.00/order** | 20 orders | $320/month (80%) | $1,704/month (85%) |
| **$5.00/order** | 16 orders | $420/month (84%) | $2,204/month (87%) |

**Why $3.50 per order is ideal:**
- Average kebab order: $15-25
- Your fee: 14-23% of order value
- Much less than UberEats (30%) or Menulog (35%)
- Customers see you as helping them compete with delivery apps

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Easy to sell ("only pay when you make money")
- ‚úÖ Scales with customer success
- ‚úÖ Lower barrier to entry
- ‚úÖ High margins (83% at scale)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Revenue fluctuates month-to-month
- ‚ùå Need tracking system for successful orders

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Model (Best for Growth)

**How it works:**
- Small base fee + per-order charge
- Covers your minimum costs + scales with usage

**Example Structure:**

| Component | Price | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| **Base fee** | $99/month | Covers first 50 orders |
| **Overage** | $2.50/order | For orders above 50 |

**Example at 200 Orders:**
- Base: $99
- Overage: 150 orders √ó $2.50 = $375
- Total revenue: $474/month
- Your cost: ~$120
- Profit: $354 (75% margin)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed minimum revenue
- ‚úÖ Still scales with customer success
- ‚úÖ Covers your fixed costs (phone number, server)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå More complex to explain
- ‚ùå Requires usage tracking

---
