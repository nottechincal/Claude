## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Exclusion Parsing** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Problem:** "No onion" was ignored
**Fix:** Added exclusion detection for "no X", "without X", "hold X"
**Files:** `kebabalab/server.py:789-818, 840-871`

### 2. **Duplicate Drinks** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Problem:** $41 instead of $34 (double-charging for drinks)
**Fix:** convertItemsToMeals now removes matching separate drinks
**Files:** `kebabalab/server.py:1789-1817`

### 3. **Speech-Friendly Output** 🟡 UX
**Problem:** AI said "vertical bar" when reading orders
**Fix:** Changed separator from " | " to ", "
**Files:** `kebabalab/server.py:1028-1029`
