---

## üìã Pre-Test Checklist

---

## üéØ Testing Strategy

Each test scenario below is designed to verify specific functionality. After each order:
1. **Listen carefully** to how the AI repeats your order
2. **Verify pricing** is correct
3. **Check for bugs** (missing items, wrong prices, incorrect customizations)
4. **Complete the order** or say "cancel" to start fresh

**Tip:** You can test multiple scenarios in one call, or make separate calls for each test.

---

## TEST 1: Basic Order with Exclusions ‚úÖ
**Tests:** Item parsing, "no X" exclusions, salad/sauce detection

### Script:
```
YOU: "Hi, I'd like to order please"
AI: [Greeting]

YOU: "I'll have a large chicken kebab with lettuce, tomato, but no onion please,
      with garlic sauce and chilli sauce"
AI: [Confirms order]

YOU: "Yes that's correct"
```

### Expected Result:
- ‚úÖ Large chicken kebab
- ‚úÖ Lettuce and tomato included
- ‚úÖ NO onion (exclusion working)
- ‚úÖ Garlic and chilli sauces
- ‚úÖ Price: $17.00

### Common Issues to Watch For:
- ‚ùå AI says "vertical bar" (should say comma)
- ‚ùå Onion is included anyway
- ‚ùå Wrong price

---

## TEST 2: HSP with No Cheese ‚úÖ
**Tests:** HSP parsing, cheese exclusion (Bug #1 fix)

### Script:
```
YOU: "I want a large chicken HSP with no cheese, just barbecue sauce please"
AI: [Confirms order]

YOU: "That's right"
```

### Expected Result:
- ‚úÖ Large chicken HSP
- ‚úÖ NO cheese (should explicitly mention no cheese)
- ‚úÖ BBQ sauce only

**Tests:** Quantity parsing, multiple items in cart

### Script:
```
YOU: "I'd like 2 small lamb kebabs and 3 Cokes please"
AI: [Confirms order]

YOU: "Yep, sounds good"
```

### Expected Result:
- ‚úÖ 2x Small lamb kebabs ($15.00 each = $30.00)
- ‚úÖ 3x Coke ($3.50 each = $10.50)
- ‚úÖ Total: $40.50

### Common Issues to Watch For:
- ‚ùå Wrong quantity (only 1 kebab or 1 coke)

---

## TEST 4: Meal Conversion (Critical Fix) ‚úÖ

YOU: "That's correct"
```

### Expected Result:

## üí° Pro Tips for Testing

1. **Test one scenario at a time** - Don't rush through all tests in one call
2. **Listen carefully** to how AI repeats your order
3. **Speak clearly** - VAPI speech recognition needs clear input
4. **Use natural language** - Test how real customers would order
5. **Take notes** - Write down any issues immediately
6. **Check logs** - Review server logs after calls for debugging
7. **Test edge cases** - Try to break it with weird orders
8. **Verify pricing** - Always check the total matches your expectation

---

## üìà Expected Results Summary

If all tests pass, you should see:

```
‚úÖ 14/14 test scenarios passed

‚úÖ All pricing correct
‚úÖ All edits processed properly
‚úÖ All conversions working (meals, combos)
‚úÖ No duplicate items
‚úÖ Natural speech output

## üö® Known Issues (Should All Be Fixed)

These were bugs we fixed - verify they're actually resolved:

1. ~~"No onion" ignored~~ ‚Üí FIXED (Round 1)

**If any of these still occur, STOP and investigate immediately.**

---

## üìû After Testing

Once testing is complete:

1. **Review call recordings** in VAPI dashboard
2. **Check server logs** for any errors
3. **Document any bugs** found
4. **Calculate success rate** (tests passed / total tests)
5. **Decide if ready for production** or needs more fixes

---

**Good luck with testing! You've got a comprehensive test suite now.** üöÄ

**Remember:** Your webhook code is already 100% tested locally (45/45 tests passing). This VAPI testing is specifically for the voice conversation layer, speech recognition, and end-to-end flow.
