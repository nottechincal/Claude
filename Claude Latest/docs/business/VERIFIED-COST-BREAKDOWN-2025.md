**Report Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** FACT-CHECKED & VERIFIED
**Exchange Rate:** 1 USD = 1.55 AUD

## üö® CRITICAL CLARIFICATION NEEDED FIRST

Based on your VAPI dashboard showing **$0.11 USD per minute**, I need to clarify your current setup:

### Question 1: How are you using ElevenLabs?

**Option A: VAPI's Built-in ElevenLabs** (Recommended - What your dashboard suggests)
- ‚úÖ You see $0.036/min on VAPI dashboard
- ‚úÖ VAPI bills you directly for voice usage
- ‚úÖ No credit limits or subscriptions needed
- ‚úÖ Pay-as-you-go through VAPI
- ‚ùå You DON'T need the $22/month ElevenLabs subscription

**Option B: Bring Your Own ElevenLabs API Key** (Not recommended)
- ‚úÖ You pay $22 USD/month to ElevenLabs directly
- ‚úÖ You get 100,000 credits/month (~100 minutes)
- ‚úÖ You add your API key to VAPI dashboard
- ‚ùå Credits run out quickly (only ~50 calls/month)
- ‚ùå You pay overage fees when credits run out
- ‚ùå More expensive at scale

### Question 2: Are you currently paying the $22/month ElevenLabs subscription?

If YES: **You might be paying twice!** You should either:
1. Cancel ElevenLabs subscription and use VAPI's built-in ($0.036/min)
2. Or use your ElevenLabs API key and save the $0.036/min VAPI charge

## üìä SCENARIO 1: USING VAPI'S BUILT-IN PROVIDERS (MOST LIKELY)

**Your VAPI Dashboard Shows:**
- Platform: $0.050/min
- Deepgram STT: $0.010/min
- GPT-4o-mini: $0.010/min
- ElevenLabs Flash v2: $0.036/min
- **TOTAL: $0.106/min USD** (rounds to $0.11/min)

**Converting to AUD:**
- $0.106 USD √ó 1.55 = **$0.164 AUD per minute**
