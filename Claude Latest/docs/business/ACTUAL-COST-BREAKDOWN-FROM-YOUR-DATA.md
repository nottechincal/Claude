## üéØ WHERE YOUR MONEY IS GOING

### October Spending Breakdown

```
Total: $163.85 AUD

VAPI Services:           $71.75  (44%)  ‚Üê Platform + STT + LLM (TTS = $0)
ElevenLabs:              $34.10  (21%)  ‚Üê Custom voice subscription

```

**Your setup is efficient - custom voice adds quality worth the cost!**

---

## ‚úÖ YOUR SETUP IS ALREADY OPTIMIZED

### Current Setup (CORRECT)

```
You ‚Üí VAPI (Platform + STT + LLM) ‚Üí $71.75/month
  ‚îî‚Üí ElevenLabs (Custom voice only) ‚Üí $34.10/month

TOTAL: $105.85/month for core services
```

**Why this is good:**
- You have a custom branded voice (worth the cost)
- VAPI TTS = $0 (using your ElevenLabs account)
- No double-billing
- Clean separation of services

### Alternative (Save $34/month but lose custom voice)

**Option:** Remove ElevenLabs API key and use VAPI's built-in voices

**Trade-off:**
- ‚úÖ Save $34.10/month
- ‚ùå Lose your custom voice
- ‚ùå Use generic AI voice instead

**My recommendation:** Keep your custom voice - it's worth the extra $34/month for brand quality

## üíº BUSINESS MODEL OPTIONS

### Option 1: Monthly Subscription (Simple)

**How it works:**
- Restaurant pays fixed monthly fee
- Unlimited calls included
- Easy to budget and sell

**Recommended Pricing Tiers:**

| Tier | Calls/Month | Your Cost | Charge Customer | Your Profit | Margin |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **Starter** | 0-100 | $114 | $250/month | $136 | 54% |
| **Growth** | 101-300 | $200 | $450/month | $250 | 56% |
| **Pro** | 301-600 | $330 | $700/month | $370 | 53% |
| **Enterprise** | 601-1000 | $600 | $1,100/month | $500 | 45% |

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Predictable revenue for you
- ‚úÖ Easy for customers to understand
- ‚úÖ Good for restaurants with consistent volume

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Risk: customer uses more than expected
- ‚ùå Underutilization: customer doesn't use full allowance

---

### Option 2: Per-Order Commission (Recommended)

**How it works:**
- You charge $3-$5 per successful order placed
- Customer only pays when they make money
- Aligns your interests with customer success

**Recommended Pricing:**

| Pricing | Break-Even Point | Cost Coverage | Profit at 100 Orders | Profit at 500 Orders |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **$3.00/order** | 38 orders | $0.57/min | $186/month (62%) | $1,170/month (78%) |
| **$3.50/order** | 33 orders | $0.49/min | $236/month (67%) | $1,420/month (81%) |
| **$4.00/order** | 29 orders | $0.43/min | $286/month (71%) | $1,670/month (83%) |
| **$5.00/order** | 23 orders | $0.34/min | $386/month (77%) | $2,170/month (87%) |

**Why $3.50 per order is ideal:**
- Average kebab order: $15-25
- Your fee: 14-23% of order value
- Much less than UberEats (30%) or Menulog (35%)
- Customers see you as helping them compete with delivery apps

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Easy to sell ("only pay when you make money")
- ‚úÖ Scales with customer success
- ‚úÖ Lower barrier to entry
- ‚úÖ High margins (83% at scale)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Revenue fluctuates month-to-month
- ‚ùå Need tracking system for successful orders

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Model (Best for Growth)

**How it works:**
- Small base fee + per-order charge
- Covers your minimum costs + scales with usage

**Example Structure:**

| Component | Price | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| **Base fee** | $99/month | Covers first 50 orders |
| **Overage** | $2.50/order | For orders above 50 |

**Example at 200 Orders:**
- Base: $99
- Overage: 150 orders √ó $2.50 = $375
- Total revenue: $474/month
- Your cost: ~$120
- Profit: $354 (75% margin)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed minimum revenue
- ‚úÖ Still scales with customer success
- ‚úÖ Covers your fixed costs (phone number, server)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå More complex to explain
- ‚ùå Requires usage tracking

---

## üéØ MY RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR BUSINESS

### Phase 1: First 5 Customers (Next 3 Months)

**Why:**
- Simple to explain: "You only pay when we help you make money"

- Easy to track (ties to your database)
- Competitive vs delivery apps

**Target customers:**
- Independent restaurants (kebabs, pizza, Chinese)
- 100-300 orders/month phone volume
- Currently losing calls during busy times

**Your pitch:**
- "Never miss a call during lunch/dinner rush"
- "Save $20/hour on phone staff"

---

### Phase 2: After 10+ Customers (Months 4-6)

**Introduce tiered monthly plans:**

- **Pro:** $399/month (includes 150 orders, $2.00 each after)
- **Enterprise:** $799/month (includes 350 orders, $1.50 each after)

**Why switch:**
