## ⚠️ Known Limitations

   - New customers get standard greeting
   - After 1st order, personalization kicks in

3. **Learning Curve:** 1-2 weeks
   - AI needs time to learn when to use new tools
   - Gradual improvement, not instant

---

## 📈 Measuring Success

Track these KPIs:

### Call Metrics
- ✅ Average call duration (should decrease)
- ✅ Calls per hour handled (should increase)
- ✅ Customer wait time (should decrease)

### Cost Metrics
- ✅ Cost per call (should drop 12-24%)
- ✅ LLM token usage (should drop ~70%)
- ✅ TTS character usage (should drop ~70%)

### Customer Satisfaction
- ✅ "That was fast!" comments (should increase)
- ✅ Repeat customer rate (should increase)
- ✅ Complaints about speed (should decrease)

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

### If something's not working:

1. **Check server logs:** `kebabalab_server.log`
2. **Run tests:** `python tests/test_performance_enhancements.py`
3. **Verify deployment:** Check VAPI dashboard shows 27 tools
4. **Read docs:** `PERFORMANCE-ENHANCEMENTS.md` has troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"AI not using new tools"**
→ Wait 1-2 weeks for learning, or check VAPI configuration

**"quickAddItem parsing wrong"**
→ Expected for ~10% of orders, falls back automatically

**"Smart greeting not personal"**
